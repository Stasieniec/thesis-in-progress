# Fair Comparison Update: Matched Subjects Across All Experiments

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before**: Your experiments were using different numbers of subjects:
- fMRI: 1035 subjects  
- sMRI: 800-870 subjects
- Cross-attention: ~800 matched subjects

**After**: All experiments now use **exactly the same matched subjects** for fair comparison.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. New Subject Matching Utility
**File**: `src/utils/subject_matching.py`
- `get_matched_subject_ids()` - Find subjects present in both modalities
- `filter_data_by_subjects()` - Filter datasets to matched subjects
- `get_matched_datasets()` - Get complete matched datasets for all experiments

### 2. Updated Training Scripts

**All three scripts now use matched subjects only:**

#### fMRI Training (`scripts/train_fmri.py`)
- **Before**: Used all 1035 fMRI subjects
- **After**: Uses only subjects that also have sMRI data
- **Change**: Calls `get_matched_datasets()` to ensure fair comparison

#### sMRI Training (`scripts/train_smri.py`)  
- **Before**: Used all available sMRI subjects
- **After**: Uses only subjects that also have fMRI data
- **Change**: Calls `get_matched_datasets()` to ensure fair comparison

#### Cross-Attention Training (`scripts/train_cross_attention.py`)
- **Before**: Already did subject matching (good!)
- **After**: Uses same matching logic as other scripts for consistency
- **Change**: Uses unified `get_matched_datasets()` function

### 3. Verification Script
**File**: `verify_matched_subjects.py`
- Checks that all experiments will use the same subjects
- Provides data statistics and consistency verification
- Run this before your experiments to confirm everything is correct

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Verify Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# In Google Colab
!python verify_matched_subjects.py
```
This will show you:
- How many subjects are matched between modalities
- Data dimensions for each experiment
- Confirmation that all experiments use the same subjects

### Step 2: Run Fair Experiments
```bash
# All experiments now use the SAME matched subjects
!python scripts/train_fmri.py run      # Fair fMRI baseline
!python scripts/train_smri.py run      # Fair sMRI baseline  
!python scripts/train_cross_attention.py run  # Fair cross-attention
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before (Unfair Comparison)
- **fMRI**: 65% accuracy on 1035 subjects
- **sMRI**: 58% accuracy on 870 subjects
- **Cross-attention**: 59% accuracy on ~800 subjects
- **Problem**: Different subject sets make comparison invalid

### After (Fair Comparison)
- **fMRI**: X% accuracy on ~800 matched subjects
- **sMRI**: Y% accuracy on ~800 matched subjects  
- **Cross-attention**: Z% accuracy on ~800 matched subjects
- **Benefit**: Fair comparison shows true method differences

### Likely Outcomes
1. **fMRI accuracy might drop** (fewer subjects, possibly harder subset)
2. **sMRI accuracy should be similar** (using subset of original data)
3. **Cross-attention comparison now meaningful** (same subjects as baselines)
4. **True method differences revealed** (not subject selection bias)

## 🔍 What the Scripts Do Now

### Automatic Subject Matching
1. **Find common subjects**: Identify subjects present in both fMRI and sMRI data
2. **Filter datasets**: Keep only matched subjects for all experiments  
3. **Verify consistency**: Ensure labels match between modalities
4. **Report statistics**: Show subject counts and class distribution

### Smart Fallbacks
- **Tries improved sMRI data first** (`processed_smri_data_improved/`)
- **Falls back to original sMRI data** if improved data not available
- **Handles Google Colab paths** automatically
- **Provides clear error messages** if data not found

## 🎯 Expected Results

After running all three experiments with matched subjects, you should see:

### Better Understanding
- **True method comparison**: No longer confounded by different subjects
- **Fair baseline comparison**: fMRI vs sMRI on same subjects
- **Valid cross-attention evaluation**: Multimodal vs unimodal on same data

### Clearer Thesis Conclusions
- **If cross-attention > both baselines**: Strong multimodal benefit
- **If cross-attention > one baseline**: Partial multimodal benefit  
- **If cross-attention ≈ best baseline**: Multimodal doesn't hurt, might help with more data
- **Any result is now scientifically valid**: Fair comparison achieved

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Data Requirements
- **Both modalities needed**: Scripts will only work with subjects having both fMRI and sMRI
- **Consistent phenotypic data**: Subject labels must match between modalities
- **Google Drive structure**: Scripts expect standard ABIDE data organization

### Backup Plan
If you encounter issues:
1. **Run verification script** to identify problems
2. **Check Google Drive mount** and data paths
3. **Verify improved sMRI data** is uploaded correctly
4. **Use original sMRI data** as fallback if needed

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Run verification**: `python verify_matched_subjects.py`
2. **Run all three experiments** with matched subjects
3. **Compare results fairly** 
4. **Analyze findings** for thesis conclusions
5. **Implement additional improvements** if needed (cross-attention architecture, tokenization, etc.)

This update ensures your thesis comparison is **scientifically sound** and **methodologically rigorous**. You now have a fair baseline to evaluate whether cross-attention truly improves over unimodal approaches!
