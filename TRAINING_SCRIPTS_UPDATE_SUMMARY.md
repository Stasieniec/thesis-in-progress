# Training Scripts Update Summary - 800 Features

## Overview
Successfully updated all training scripts and configurations to use the improved 800-feature sMRI data instead of the previous 300-400 features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Cross-Attention Training Script
**File**: `scripts/train_cross_attention.py`
- **Line 60**: Updated `smri_feat_selection: int = 300` â†’ `smri_feat_selection: int = 800`
- **Impact**: Cross-attention model will now use all 800 improved sMRI features

### 2. sMRI Training Script
**File**: `scripts/train_smri.py`
- **Line 607**: Updated documentation `"feature_selection_k: 300 (was 100-200)"` â†’ `"feature_selection_k: 800 (was 300-400)"`
- **Line 647**: Updated documentation `"Better hyperparameters (300 features, optimal LR)"` â†’ `"Better hyperparameters (800 features, optimal LR)"`
- **Default parameter**: Already correctly set to `feature_selection_k: int = 800`

### 3. Configuration Classes
**File**: `src/config/config.py`
- **SMRIConfig**: Cleaned up duplicate `feature_selection_k` declarations, kept `800`
- **CrossAttentionConfig**: Updated `smri_feat_selection: int = 300` â†’ `smri_feat_selection: int = 800`
- **Impact**: All configurations now consistently use 800 features

### 4. Documentation Updates
**File**: `README.md`
- **Completed Tasks**: Added "Updated training scripts to use 800 features (vs 300-400)"
- **In Progress**: Removed the completed training script update task

## Verification

### Parameters Updated
- âœ… `scripts/train_cross_attention.py`: 300 â†’ 800 features
- âœ… `scripts/train_smri.py`: Documentation updated to reflect 800 features
- âœ… `src/config/config.py`: SMRIConfig uses 800 features
- âœ… `src/config/config.py`: CrossAttentionConfig uses 800 features

### Test/Debug Parameters (Intentionally Left Smaller)
- ðŸ”§ `scripts/train_smri.py` quick_test: Uses 100 features (for fast testing)
- ðŸ”§ `scripts/train_smri.py` benchmark: Uses 200 features (for comparison)
- **Note**: These smaller values are appropriate for testing and debugging

## Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements
- **sMRI Models**: Better feature representation with 800 vs 300-400 features
- **Cross-Attention**: Enhanced multimodal learning with richer sMRI features
- **Overall**: Expected accuracy improvement across all models

### Training Considerations
- **Memory Usage**: Slightly higher due to increased feature dimension
- **Training Time**: Minimal impact, similar computational complexity
- **Convergence**: May converge better with more informative features

## Usage Verification

### For sMRI Training
```bash
# Default now uses 800 features
python scripts/train_smri.py run

# Explicitly set (redundant, but possible)
python scripts/train_smri.py run --feature_selection_k=800
```

### For Cross-Attention Training
```bash
# Default now uses 800 sMRI features
python scripts/train_cross_attention.py run

# Explicitly set (redundant, but possible) 
python scripts/train_cross_attention.py run --smri_feat_selection=800
```

### Google Colab Usage
```python
# In Google Colab notebooks
!python scripts/train_smri.py run
!python scripts/train_cross_attention.py run
# Both will automatically use 800 features
```

## Data Compatibility

### Required Data Format
- **Features**: `features.npy` with shape `(870, 800)`
- **Labels**: `labels.npy` with shape `(870,)`
- **Metadata**: Compatible metadata.json
- **Source**: Generated by `scripts/improved_smri_extraction_new.py`

### Google Drive Integration
- **Updated Data**: Available via `update_to_improved_smri.py`
- **Path**: `/content/drive/MyDrive/processed_smri_data_improved/`
- **Backup**: Old 300-feature data backed up as `processed_smri_data_backup_300features/`

## Next Steps

### Ready to Execute
1. **Train sMRI Model**: `python scripts/train_smri.py run`
2. **Train Cross-Attention**: `python scripts/train_cross_attention.py run`  
3. **Compare Results**: Evaluate 800-feature vs previous performance

### Expected Results
- **sMRI**: Improved from 55% â†’ 57-60% â†’ potentially higher with transformers
- **Cross-Attention**: Enhanced multimodal performance with better sMRI features
- **Overall**: Progress toward 70%+ accuracy target

## Conclusion

All training scripts and configurations have been successfully updated to use the improved 800-feature sMRI data. The codebase is now fully compatible with the enhanced sMRI extraction pipeline and ready for training with the improved features.

The changes maintain backward compatibility for testing functions while ensuring all production training uses the optimal 800-feature configuration.
