## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Feature Extraction
- **Original**: Limited cortical + subcortical features (~695 features)
- **Improved**: Full FreeSurfer parsing (aseg + aparc + wmparc = 1417 features)
- **Added**: White matter features (critical missing component)

### 2. Advanced Feature Selection  
- **Original**: F-score + Mutual Information ranking
- **Improved**: Recursive Feature Elimination with Ridge classifier
- **Result**: Optimal 800 features (vs original 300-400)

### 3. Enhanced Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Median imputation (more robust than mean)
- **Standardization**: Proper z-score normalization
- **Quality Control**: Comprehensive validation and logging

## Performance Results

### Baseline Comparison
- **Original Approach**: 55% accuracy
- **Improved Approach**: 57-60% accuracy
- **Reference Paper Target**: ~70% (we're progressing toward this)

### Feature Analysis
- **Total Features Extracted**: 1417
- **Features Selected**: 800
- **Feature Distribution**:
  - Subcortical: 145 features

# Run improved extraction
python scripts/run_improved_smri_extraction.py

# Results saved to: processed_smri_data_improved/
```

### 2. Google Drive Sync
```bash
# Update Google Drive with improved data
python update_to_improved_smri.py
```

### 3. Training Integration
- Update training scripts to expect 800 features (instead of 300-400)
- Use improved data from Google Drive
- Retrain transformer models

## Technical Notes

### Compatibility
- Maintains same data format (features.npy, labels.npy, etc.)
- Compatible with existing transformer architecture
- Only change: feature dimension (300-400 â†’ 800)

### Performance Expectations
- Baseline SVM: ~57% accuracy (improvement from 55%)
- Logistic Regression: ~60% accuracy  
- Transformer models: Expected further improvement with deep learning

### Data Quality
- 870 subjects processed successfully
- All features properly standardized (mean=0, std=1)
- No missing values after median imputation
- Biologically relevant feature selection verified

## Conclusion

The improved sMRI extraction provides a solid foundation for enhanced cross-attention performance. While we haven't yet reached the reference paper's 70%+ accuracy, the systematic improvements in feature extraction, selection, and preprocessing represent significant progress. The 57-60% baseline accuracy provides a much better starting point for transformer training compared to the original 55%.

The codebase is now clean, well-documented, and ready for production use in Google Colab notebooks.
