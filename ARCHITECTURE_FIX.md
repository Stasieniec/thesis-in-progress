# 🔧 sMRI Architecture Fix - Back to Working Approach

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**

The sMRI performance **dropped from 60% → 52% → 50%** because we used the wrong architectural approach:

### ❌ **Failing CLS Token Approach** (50% accuracy)
- Treated sMRI features as sequences requiring CLS tokens
- Over-complicated architecture for tabular data
- Wrong inductive bias for structural features
- Forced sequence modeling on non-sequential data

### ✅ **Working Notebook Approach** (60% accuracy)
- Treats sMRI as single feature vector (correct!)
- Simple sequence dimension + positional embedding
- Global pooling instead of CLS token extraction
- Appropriate for tabular/structural data

## 🔄 **Architecture Changes Made**

| Component | Before (CLS) | After (Working) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Input Processing** | `CLS + feature tokens` | `Single feature vector` |
| **Sequence Length** | `2 (CLS + features)` | `1 (features only)` |
| **Positional Embedding** | `(1, 2, d_model)` | `(1, 1, d_model)` |
| **Classification** | `CLS token extraction` | `Global pooling + squeeze` |
| **Head Structure** | `Single classifier` | `pre_classifier + classifier` |

## 📊 **Expected Results**

| Model | Previous | Expected | Improvement |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **sMRI** | 50.2% | ~60% | +10% |
| **fMRI** | 65.4% | ~65% | Same |
| **Cross-Attention** | 63.6% | ~63% | Same |

## 🧠 **Why This Matters**

### **Data Type Understanding:**
- **fMRI**: Time series → Sequences → CLS tokens make sense
- **sMRI**: Pre-computed features → Tabular → Simple processing needed

### **Architecture Alignment:**
- **Working notebook**: Proved 60% accuracy with simple approach
- **Our fix**: Matches working notebook exactly
- **Previous attempt**: Wrong paradigm (sequence modeling)

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test Architecture**: `python test_fixed_smri.py`
2. **Run sMRI Training**: `python scripts/train_smri.py`
3. **Expect Improvement**: 50% → 60% accuracy
4. **Cross-Attention**: Should benefit from better sMRI features

## 🎉 **Key Insight**

> **Not all data needs sequence modeling!** sMRI structural features are already processed/aggregated - they need simple, direct classification, not complex sequence attention.

The CLS token approach works great for:
- ✅ **Text** (word sequences)
- ✅ **Images** (patch sequences) 
- ✅ **fMRI** (time sequences)

But NOT for:
- ❌ **sMRI** (pre-computed structural features)
- ❌ **Tabular data** (feature vectors)
- ❌ **Already aggregated data**

This fix should restore the 60% performance from your working notebook! 🎯
