# Cross-Attention sMRI-fMRI Analysis for Autism Classification

## Project Overview

This repository implements a cross-attention transformer model for autism classification using both structural MRI (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) data from the ABIDE dataset. The project focuses on achieving better classification performance through multimodal brain imaging analysis.

## Recent Improvements (December 2024)

### Enhanced sMRI Processing âœ¨
- **Improved Feature Extraction**: Comprehensive FreeSurfer parsing (aseg + aparc + wmparc)
- **Advanced Feature Selection**: RFE with Ridge classifier selecting 800 optimal features
- **Better Preprocessing**: Median imputation, proper standardization
- **Performance Gain**: Improved from 55% to 57-60% baseline accuracy

### Current Performance
- **fMRI Accuracy**: 65% (good performance)
- **sMRI Accuracy**: 57-60% (improved from 55%)
- **Target**: Reach reference paper's ~70% sMRI accuracy

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Ensure data directory exists
ls data/freesurfer_stats/  # Should contain subject folders (50003, 50004, etc.)
```

### 2. Process sMRI Data (Improved Pipeline)
```bash
# Run enhanced sMRI extraction
python scripts/run_improved_smri_extraction.py

# Results will be saved to: processed_smri_data_improved/
```

### 3. Sync with Google Drive (for Colab)
```bash
# Update Google Drive with improved data
python update_to_improved_smri.py
```

### 4. Train Models
```bash
# Train individual modalities
python scripts/train_smri.py      # sMRI transformer
python scripts/train_fmri.py      # fMRI transformer

# Train cross-attention model
python scripts/train_cross_attention.py
```
